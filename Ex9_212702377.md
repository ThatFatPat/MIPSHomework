## Question 1
### Question 1.a
`add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `slt`, `lw`
We can't write to the registers, so these instructions won't function properly.
### Question 1.b
The `fetch` stage won't work properly, so no instructions will run.
### Question 1.c
`sw`
### Question 1.d
We can't change the IR, so no instructions will run.
### Question 1.e
We can't update `$pc`, so only the first instruction will run.
### Question 1.f
`beq` - We can't branch
### Question 1.g
`add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `slt`. We're not choosing our destination register properly on R-type instructions.

## Question 2
### Question 2.a
According to the formula (` CPU Time = IC*CPI*Clock `):

```python
clock = 1/(600 * 10**6)
time = 28
ic = 4 * 10**9

CPI = time/(ic*clock)
>>> 4.2
```

### Question 2.b
```
L = 2M
M = 15D
O = IC - D - M - L = 4 * 10**9 - D - 15D - 30D = 4 * 10**9 - 46D
Total Cycles = 50D + 12*15D + 2*30D + 4 * 10**9 - 46D = Time * F = 28*600*(10**6)
244D = 28*600*(10**6) - 4 * 10**9
D = (28*600*(10**6) - 4 * 10**9)/244
D = (32/61)(10**8)
```
Now that we have the amount of Divide instructions, let's calculate the speedup.
```python
frac_en = (32/61)*(10**8)/(4*10**9) * 50 / 4.2
CPI_new = 4.2*((1-frac_en)+frac_en/(50/22)) ~ 3.83
Speedup = CPI_old/CPI_new = 4.2/CPI_new
Speedup ~ 1.096
```
### Question 2.c
According to the original formula:
```python
f2 = (IC/IC)*f_original*(CPI_original/CPI_new2)
CPI_new2 = 4.2*((1-(frac_en*50/4.2))+(frac_en*50/4.2)/(50/13))
f2 = (CPI_new2/4.2)*(600*(10**6))
f2 ~ 530 Mhz
```
