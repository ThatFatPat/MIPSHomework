## Question 1
### Question 1.a
If `RegWrite` is zero we cannot use the WB stage, and so the commands the instructions that'll be affected are:
 - add
 - sub
 - and
 - or
 - slt
 - lw

### Question 1.b
If `ALUop0` is always `0`, then we will not be able to access 1 out of 3 states: `ALUop = 01`
This state is used for branch instructions, such as `beq` and `bne`.
For this reason, the ops on the list that will be affected are:
 - beq

### Question 1.c
If `ALUop1` is always `0`, then we will not be able to access 1 out of 3 states: `ALUop = 10`
This state is used for R-type instructions, and encomapsses all operations specified by the `funct` bits.
The instructions that will be affected then are:
- add
- sub
- and
- or
- slt

### Question 1.d
If `Branch` is always `0`, we cannot branch. Jumps are unaffected.
The affected instructions:
 - beq

### Question 1.e 
If `MemRead` is always `0`, we cannot read from memory.
Therefore the affected instructions are:
- lw

### Question 1.f
If `MemWrite` is always `0`, we cannot write to memory.
Therefore the instructions affected will be:
- sw
