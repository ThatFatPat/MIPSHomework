## Question 1
### Question 1.a
If `RegWrite` is zero we cannot use the WB stage, and so the commands the instructions that'll be affected are:
 - add
 - sub
 - and
 - or
 - slt
 - lw

### Question 1.b
If `ALUop0` is always `0`, then we will not be able to access 1 out of 3 states: `ALUop = 01`
This state is used for branch instructions, such as `beq` and `bne`.
For this reason, the ops on the list that will be affected are:
 - beq

### Question 1.c
If `ALUop1` is always `0`, then we will not be able to access 1 out of 3 states: `ALUop = 10`
This state is used for R-type instructions, and encomapsses all operations specified by the `funct` bits.
The instructions that will be affected then are:
- add
- sub
- and
- or
- slt

### Question 1.d
If `Branch` is always `0`, we cannot branch. Jumps are unaffected.
The affected instructions:
 - beq

### Question 1.e 
If `MemRead` is always `0`, we cannot read from memory.
Therefore the affected instructions are:
 - lw

### Question 1.f
If `MemWrite` is always `0`, we cannot write to memory.
Therefore the instructions affected will be:
 - sw

## Question 2
### Question 2.a
For `sub` instructions we don't use the memory, and so:
 - Mem
 
### Question 2.b
For `jump` instructions we don't use the ALU, Memory or Write-Back as the jump is a J-Type instruction.
 - Exec
 - Mem
 - WB

### Question 2.c
For `lw` instructions we require all parts of the processor, as we need to fetch, decode, calculate the offset from the source register, fetch the data from memory and write back to `WriteRegister`.

### Question 2.d
For `sw` instrucitons we require everything just as `lw`, except the write-back, because in the case of `sw` we are placing the word in memory and so don't write to the registers.
 - WB

### Question 2.e
For `beq` instructions we don't write or read from memory, as well as not writing back to the registers.
 - Memory
 - WB

## Question 3
### Question 3.a
To add `jr`, we'll need to add an I-type instruction, as well as a control bit as follows:
We'll connect ALUresult to the Jump MUX, extending it to a 3-to-1 (4-to-1).
We'll add a second jump control bit, and choose the encoding for `jump` and `jr`.

Alternatively, we can use the branch and jump bits as a 2-bit structure, encoding up to 4 states.
Currently, we have a branch bit and a jump bit, encoding 3 states: Branch, Jump (J-type) and Do Nothing.
We can turn those to MUXes to one MUX with a 2 bit selector, and add ALUresult as one of the inputs.

### Question 3.b
To add `sll` we'll need to add an R-type instruction, as well as add an operation in the ALU.
There are no special control bits or logic gates needed besides that.

### Question 3.c
To add `bne` we'll need to add an additional branch bit, `BranchNotEqual` and change the branch MUX selector as follows:
```
AND(Branch, ALUzero) => OR(AND(Branch, ALUzero), AND(BranchNotEqual, NOT(ALUzero)))
```
### Question 3.d
To add `ori` we'll need to add an I-type instruction, meaning we need to use ALUop to specify the operation for the ALU. Luckily, we have an available state: `ALUop = 11`.
And so, besides adding the operation inside the ALU, no other adjustments are needed.

### Question 3.e
To add `new_lw`, we need to add an R-type instruction. We'll use $s1 + $s2 as the address for the MemRead, and WriteBack to $s0. No special control bits or logic gates need to be added. We just need to ensure to light up `MemtoReg`, `MemRead`, `RegWrite`, `ALUop = 10` (For R-type instructions)

### Question 3.f
To add `jnezr`, we'll need to extend the `ALUSrc` MUX to include a "0", extend the Branch MUX to include `Read data 2`
Extending the Branch MUX entails adding a control bit, and encoding the states. This means we'll have to change the branch MUX selector. Let's assume the states are encoded as follows: `NO_ACTION: Branch = 00, beq: Branch = 01, jnezr: Branch = 10`. If that is the case, we can then connect the MUX selector as follows:
```
Bit 0: AND(Branch0, ALUzero)
Bit 1: AND(Branch1, NOT(ALUzero))
```
We'll connect `Read data 2` to the `10` state in the MUX.
Then, in order to `jnezr`, all we have to do is set `Branch` to `10` and `Jump` to `0`.
By doing this we will select `Read data 2` as the branch address and branch.

## Question 4
We want to jump from address `1990` to `2018`.
```python
2018 - 1990 = 28 # Calculate offset.

28 / 4 = 7       # Jump offsets are shifted left by 2, so we need to account for that.

7 - 1 = 6        # 4 is added to PC after before it is summed with our jump offset,
                 # Meaning we are actually calculating the offset to 
                 # the instruction before the one we want to jump to.
```
And so the offset we will encode is `6`.
