## Question 1
### Question 1.a
`add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `slt`, `lw`
We can't write to the registers, so these instructions won't function properly.
### Question 1.b
The `fetch` stage won't work properly, so no instructions will run.
### Question 1.c
`sw`
### Question 1.d
We can't change the IR, so no instructions will run.
### Question 1.e
We can't update `$pc`, so only the first instruction will run.
### Question 1.f
`beq` - We can't branch
### Question 1.g
`add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `slt`. We're not choosing our destination register properly on R-type instructions.

## Question 2
### Question 2.a
According to the formula (` CPU Time = IC*CPI*Clock `):

```python
clock = 1/(600 * 10**6)
time = 28
ic = 4 * 10**9

CPI = time/(ic*clock)
>>> 4.2
```

### Question 2.b
```
L = 2M
M = 15D
O = IC - D - M - L = 4 * 10**9 - D - 15D - 30D = 4 * 10**9 - 46D
Total Cycles = 50D + 12*15D + 2*30D + 4 * 10**9 - 46D = Time * F = 28*600*(10**6)
244D = 28*600*(10**6) - 4 * 10**9
D = (28*600*(10**6) - 4 * 10**9)/244
D = (32/61)(10**8)
```
Now that we have the amount of Divide instructions, let's calculate the speedup.
```python
frac_en = (32/61)*(10**8)/(4*10**9) * 50 / 4.2
CPI_new = 4.2*((1-frac_en)+frac_en/(50/22)) ~ 3.83
Speedup = CPI_old/CPI_new = 4.2/CPI_new
Speedup ~ 1.096
```
### Question 2.c
According to the original formula:
```python
f2 = (IC/IC)*f_original*(CPI_original/CPI_new2)
CPI_new2 = 4.2*((1-(frac_en*50/4.2))+(frac_en*50/4.2)/(50/13))
f2 = (CPI_new2/4.2)*(600*(10**6))
f2 ~ 530 Mhz
```

## Question 3
### Question 3.a
We'll use an I-type. Extending the selector `MemToReg` to a 2-bit selector, we can add another encoded option to take the upper 16 bits and connect them straight to `Write Register`. **3** Cycles Total
### Question 3.b
We'll use another I-type. Extending the selector `IorD` to a 2-bit selector, we can add another encoded option to take the extended immediate and connect it to `Address`. We can add a state for reading the memory, followed by a write state.
### Question 3.c
We'll use an I-type. Extending the selector `ALUSrcA` we can add another option in the MUX and another option to the (2-bit) `IorD` MUX from Register Data A, then another final bit to control whether the memory address is as it was before (when not set) or ALUOut, using a new MUX along the WriteData path.
We'll add the following path:
  1. Fetch
  2. Decode
  3. ALUSrcA = 10, ALUSrcB = 00, ALUOp = 00
  4. MemWrite = 1, new IorD option, new bit is set.
4 cycles
### Question 3.d
We'll use the bits




## Question 4
```python
CPI_A * 1/F = (0.01 * 3 + 0.14 * 5 + 0.3 * 5 + 0.05 * 6 + 0.35 * 6 + 0.15 * 5)
* 1/(100 * 10**6) ~ 5.38 * 10**(-8)
CPI_B * 1/F = (0.01 * 4 + 0.14 * 6 + 0.3 * 6 + 0.05 * 8 + 0.35 * 8 + 0.15 * 6)
* 1/(120 * 10**6) ~ 5.65 * 10**(-8)

A is preferable for Prog 1

CPI_A * 1/F = (0.01 * 3 + 0.04 * 5 + 0.25 * 5 + 0.2 * 6 + 0.45 * 6 + 0.05 * 5)
* 1/(100 * 10**6) ~ 5.63 * 10**(-8)
CPI_B * 1/F = (0.01 * 4 + 0.04 * 6 + 0.25 * 6 + 0.2 * 8 + 0.45 * 8 + 0.05 * 6)
* 1/(120 * 10**6) ~ 6.06 * 10**(-8)

A is preferable for Prog 2
```
