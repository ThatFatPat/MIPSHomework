## Question 1
### Question 1.a
2KB of memory can be represented in 11 bits, therefore we need to subtract that amount from the total bits used to represent an address to get the number of pages.
```
	(2**64)/(2**11) = 2**53
```
### Question 1.b
- Page Offset: 11 bits as explained above.
- VPN: ```(2**64)/(2**11) = 2**53```
- PPN: 16GB is represented in 34 bits, therefore: ```(2**34)/(2**11) = 2**23```

### Question 1.c
256 indices can be represented 

## Question 2
### Question 2.a
The page size is 4KB. 4KB of memory can be represented using 12 bits.

A virtual address then is represented as (`x` bits, 12 bits) for (VPN, Offset),
where `x` is the address size subtracted 16. (Since the address size is not given to us at any point we can only make calculated assumptions based on the size of a page entry in the page table).

### Question 2.b
| Address | VPN | PFN | Address | Data |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----------|--------|
| 0x803002  | 803 | 5   | 0x5002    | 0x5    |
| 0x80300B  | 803 | 5   | 0x500B    | 0x19   |
| 0x801009  | 801 | 6   | 0x6009    | 0x85   |
| 0x403001  | 403 | 7   | 0x7001    | 0x37   |
| 0x403006  | 403 | 7   | 0x7006    | 0x44   |

### Question 2.c
```
A1:
	0x803002: TLB (MISS) -> PT => PFN = 5
	0x5002: CACHE (MISS) -> MEM => Data = 0x5
	10 (TLB) + 100 (PT==MEM) + 10 (CACHE) + 100 (MEM) = 220 Cycles
A2:
	0x80300B: TLB (HIT) => PFN = 5
	0x500B: CACHE (MISS) -> MEM => Data = 0x19
	10 (TLB) + 10 (CACHE) + 100 (MEM) = 210 Cycles
A3:
	0x801009: TLB (MISS) -> PT => PFN = 6
	0x6009: CACHE (MISS) -> MEM => Data = 0x85
	10 (TLB) + 100 (PT==MEM) + 10 (CACHE) + 100 (MEM) = 220 Cycles
A4:
	0x403001: TLB (MISS) -> PT => PFN = 7
	0x7001: CACHE (MISS) -> MEM => Data = 0x37
	10 (TLB) + 100 (PT==MEM) + 10 (CACHE) + 100 (MEM) = 220 Cycles
A5:
	0x403006: TLB (HIT) => PFN = 7
	0x7006: CACHE (HIT) => Data = 0x44
	10 (TLB) + 10 (CACHE) = 20 Cycles
```
