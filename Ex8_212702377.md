## Question 1
### Question 1.a
If `RegWrite` is zero we cannot use the WB stage, and so the commands the instructions that'll be affected are:
 - add
 - sub
 - and
 - or
 - slt
 - lw

### Question 1.b
If `ALUop0` is always `0`, then we will not be able to access 1 out of 3 states: `ALUop = 01`
This state is used for branch instructions, such as `beq` and `bne`.
For this reason, the ops on the list that will be affected are:
 - beq
