## Question 1
### Question 1.a
2KB of memory can be represented in 11 bits, therefore we need to subtract that amount from the total bits used to represent an address to get the number of pages.
```
(2**64)/(2**11) = 2**53
```
### Question 1.b
- Page Offset: 11 bits as explained above.
- VPN: ```(2**64)/(2**11) = 2**53```
- PPN: 16GB is represented in 34 bits, therefore: ```(2**34)/(2**11) = 2**23```

### Question 1.c
256 indices can be represented in 8 bits. Therefore the virtual address for direct mapped cache will be the following:
```
(45 bits, 8 bits, 11 bits) for (Tag, Index, Offset)
```

### Question 1.d
For fully associative cache, index is irrelevant. (Pages can be mapped to every spot in the TLB)
```
(53 bits, 0 bits, 11 bits) for (Tag, Index, Offset)
```

### Question 1.e
We are going to have to access the page table very frequently. We can solve this by either increasing the amount of pages in the TLB to 500 so that all pages fit in the TLB or increasing the page size up to 2MB so that we don't have to fill out the entire page table. The "correct" solution is obviously a balance between increasing page size and TLB size in a manner that accomodates some sort of cost-efficiency model or some other model based on real world requirements.

## Question 2
### Question 2.a
The page size is 4KB. 4KB of memory can be represented using 12 bits.

A virtual address then is represented as (`x` bits, 12 bits) for (VPN, Offset),
where `x` is the address size subtracted 16. (Since the address size is not given to us at any point we can only make calculated assumptions based on the size of a page entry in the page table).

### Question 2.b
| Address | VPN | PPN | Address | Data |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----------|--------|
| 0x803002  | 803 | 5   | 0x5002    | 0x5    |
| 0x80300B  | 803 | 5   | 0x500B    | 0x19   |
| 0x801009  | 801 | 6   | 0x6009    | 0x85   |
| 0x403001  | 403 | 7   | 0x7001    | 0x37   |
| 0x403006  | 403 | 7   | 0x7006    | 0x44   |

### Question 2.c
```
A1:
	0x803002: TLB (MISS) -> PT => PPN = 5
	0x5002: CACHE (MISS) -> MEM => Data = 0x5
	10 (TLB) + 100 (PT==MEM) + 10 (CACHE) + 100 (MEM) = 220 Cycles
A2:
	0x80300B: TLB (HIT) => PPN = 5
	0x500B: CACHE (MISS) -> MEM => Data = 0x19
	10 (TLB) + 10 (CACHE) + 100 (MEM) = 210 Cycles
A3:
	0x801009: TLB (MISS) -> PT => PPN = 6
	0x6009: CACHE (MISS) -> MEM => Data = 0x85
	10 (TLB) + 100 (PT==MEM) + 10 (CACHE) + 100 (MEM) = 220 Cycles
A4:
	0x403001: TLB (MISS) -> PT => PPN = 7
	0x7001: CACHE (MISS) -> MEM => Data = 0x37
	10 (TLB) + 100 (PT==MEM) + 10 (CACHE) + 100 (MEM) = 220 Cycles
A5:
	0x403006: TLB (HIT) => PPN = 7
	0x7006: CACHE (HIT) => Data = 0x44
	10 (TLB) + 10 (CACHE) = 20 Cycles
```

## Question 3
### Question 3.a
256MB of memory can be represented in 28 bits. 4KB in 12 bits. Therefore:
```
(2**28)/(2**12) = 2**16
```

### Question 3.b
Our index in the TLB can be represented in 8 bits, we already know the offset size, therefore:
```
(12 bits, 8 bits, 12 bits) for (Tag, Index, Offset)
```

### Question 3.c + 3.d
| INDEX   | PPN    | Valid | Dirty | Used |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|------|
| ...     |        |       |       |      |
| 0x51F   | 0xF000 | 1     | 0     | 0    |
| ...     |        |       |       |      |
| 0x99FF  | 0xB000 | 1     |       |      |
| ...     |        |       |       |      |
| 0xFB00  | 0xF    | 1     | 0     |      |
| ...     |        |       |       |      |
| 0x1F201 | 0xF0   | 1     |       |      |
| ...     |        |       |       |      |
| 0x7C602 | 0xF00  | 1     | 0     | 0    |
| ...     |        |       |       |      |

### Question 3.d
```
A1:
	0x0FB 00 ABC: Tag 0xFB, Row #0 => PPN = 0xF => 0xFABC
A2:
	0x7C6 01 1F2: Tag 0x7C6, Row #1, NOT MAPPED!
A3:
	0x005 1F FBC: Tag 0x005, Row #31 => PPN = 0xF000 => 0xF000FBC
A4:
	0x1F2 01 9F0: Tag 0x1F2, Row #1 => PPN = 0xF0 => 0xF09F0
```
