## Question 1
### Question 1.a
`add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `slt`, `lw`
We can't write to the registers, so these instructions won't function properly.
### Question 1.b
The `fetch` stage won't work properly, so no instructions will run.
### Question 1.c
`sw`
### Question 1.d
We can't change the IR, so no instructions will run.
### Question 1.e
We can't update `$pc`, so only the first instruction will run.
### Question 1.f
`beq` - We can't branch
### Question 1.g
`add`, `sub`, `and`, `or`, `slt`. We're not choosing our destination register properly on R-type instructions.
