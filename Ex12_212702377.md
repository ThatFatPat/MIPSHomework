## Question 2
### Question 2.a
The page size is 4KB. 4KB of memory can be represented using 12 bits.
A virtual address then is represented as (x bits, 12 bits) for (VPN, Offset),
where x is the address size subtracted 16. (Since the address size is not given to us at any point we can only make calculated assumptions based on the size of a page entry in the page table).

### Question 2.b
| Address | VPN | PFN | Address | Data |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|------|
| 803002  | 803 | 5   | 5002    | 5    |
| 80300B  | 803 | 5   | 500B    | 19   |
| 801009  | 801 | 6   | 6009    | 85   |
| 403001  | 403 | 7   | 7001    | 37   |
| 403006  | 403 | 7   | 7006    | 44   |

### Question 2.c
```
A1:
	0x803002: TLB (MISS) -> PT (PFN = 5)
	0x5002: CACHE (MISS) -> MEM
	10 (TLB) + 100 (PT==MEM) + 10 (CACHE) + 100 (MEM) = 220 Cycles 
```
