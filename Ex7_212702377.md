## Question 1
### Question 1.a
```
$v0 = 2
```
This program loops over two given arrays. It will stop on the first iteration the arrays differ, and count only the iterations in which they are similar.

Therefore in this case `$v0` will be `2` as the arrays differ on the **3rd** element.

### Question 1.b
```
A = [1, 8, 25, 18]
B = [5, 7, 9, 18]
```
This program performs the following operation on the **ith** (0-based) iteration
```
A[i+1] = A[i+2] + B[i]
```
Since we know that before entering the loop `$a2 = 3` and `$t0 = 1`, as well as the fact that `$t0` is the loop counter,
if the loop stops when `$a2 == $t0` then we'll perform **2** iterations.
And so, we get the solution described above.
